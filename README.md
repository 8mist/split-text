## TypeScript Support

SplitText is written in TypeScript and provides type definitions.

> **Note:** TypeScript is not required to use SplitText.

> **üí° TIP:** Type annotations are very useful and help your IDE understand the type provided by
> SplitText. <br /> The IDEs (VSCode, WebStorm, etc.) will be able to provide you with
> autocompletion and type hints.
